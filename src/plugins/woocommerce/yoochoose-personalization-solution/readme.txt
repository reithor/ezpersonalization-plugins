YOOCHOOSE’s Recommendation Engine in Detail:

Our Recommendation Engine knows the tastes and interests of your visitors and customers, and it constantly learns from
them. Always recommend the right products at the right moment in real time, and in doing so, improve conversion rates
and customer retention. These days, customers expect high-quality recommendations that further round out the shopping
experience.

* Higher conversion rates when visitors become customers
* Increase the average order quantity with appropriate cross-selling and up-selling recommendations
* Create an individual shopping experience for your customers with personalized product recommendations

* Reduce the number of people who abandon the shopping cart with products that are always appropriate
* Discover more about your customers through statistical analysis
* In the process, help your customers to enjoy shopping with you!

Recommendations can be displayed in any part of your online store. The most commonly used scenarios are:

* Personalized recommendations on the homepage
* A category’s top sellers in the category overview
* Automated cross-selling on the product detail page ("Other customers also bought/also looked at:")
* Complementary product recommendations in your shopping cart, based on the products that are already in your shopping cart ("You might also be interested in.")
* Display browsing history to facilitate navigation
